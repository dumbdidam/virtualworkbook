            <b><em>Overview:<br></em></b>
            <br>
            Interestingly, I was enrolled in a different class in the first week. Due to a friend, I was interested in this subject and decided to switch and partake in this since I have always taken a liking in web design. Furthermore, I took a media computation class several semesters ago where I can use the knowledge there and further improve my skills. Since I needed to catch up, I decided to look at some of unique websites with <em>interactivity</em> with very different identities to each of them as a starting point of where I want my own website to look feel. Also, it will help me give an idea how <em>Interactive Media</em> is able to push digital design as well!

            These websites that I've gathered were more focused on the human and website interactions rather than the design aspect of them. I wanted to understand how interactive media has been used even in the most simplistic forms. It was interesting to see the countless possibilities you could do with web design and coding.

            <br>
            I began to visualize and brainstorm how my workbook website will look visually. Throughout this week I looked at several web designs that I found were coherent in their presentation and innovative in terms of its concept and arrangements. I did several sketching workshops as well as it helped me freely create my web front end design without already thinking too much of the technical aspects. At the end of the day, the website should be uniquely yourself and shouldn’t be limited to certain ideas. Starting the coding part was important and I did only html and few css since I wanted to focus more on the layout whereas the functionality will follow along later on.

            Shared several hand picked web designs that I got around to look for in my spare time. These websites to me hold an array of amazing design considerations where they implement their own visual style and language in a unique manner. I love how different they all are and inspiring to me as someone who is trying to create my own site from scratch. There were several characteristics that I took from each of them from the use of color palettes, considering the appropriate typeface to compliment the designs as well as using any other external elements such as images, logos and videos.

            <br>
            The prototyping exercise made me realize that there are various ways I can present my weekly workbook in a creative manner. I realized a lot of these would need repeating elements in order to present the weekly progress in a sufficient way. I loved the results of the left hand side sketches, especially the two middle ones. Initially I wanted to use the octopus wireframe webbings as the design, however I felt that it might not translate too well and the design language is not something I'm particularly a fan of. I loved the overlapping tabs sketch I made, reminding me of virus windows opening up in a computer. That one might be more simple than the previous iteration but I love how I can do a lot visually with it by adding other elements to complement it.

            This week and until the submission date, it’s all about applying the concept of the website into <em>VisualStudioCode</em>. I focused on the html and css aspects first, and then applying the javascript commands onto them. I wanted to focus the visual elements beforehand since I wanted to make sure visually, the design elements all work well alongside one another.

            Handpicked web design inspirations that I want to take the techniques and functionalities of, as their interactive design theme is similar to what I'm trying to replicate in my own design. I really love the abstract and lack of neatness within these websites, which almost bring a raw nature to the design. I want my own website to be eye catching and loud from the moment users open it. In a way, I want the users to slowly explore all the elements within my website instead of the website guiding them along.

            These selected JS codes were the most important ones in helping the user experience of the website. I made sure to have a draggable function for all the separate div windows. Also the implementation of a minimize and expand button to create a flexible impression to the user, allowing them to choose how they want to interact with the respective divs windows. Also since I added the file icons which are clickable, I wanted them to be coded so that it will open up the div windows accordingly. Finally I added a unique detail of code by adding a custom clock that is appropriate to your current location. I feel like these JS commands and the other codes that were not mentioned played an integral part in creating character and depth to the website. It was my goal early on to not only make a website that is visually pleasing, but functional as well.

            <br>
            This was the start of a new interactive media topic, <em>p5js</em>. There were several new terms and techniques that we were introduced to, as well as preparing ourselves for the next few weeks. With  <em>p5js</em>, there were a lot of new possibilities I found to be able to do in terms of creating an actual interactive website that I might apply to my own as it really pushes technical aspects of web design that might be difficult to do in basic javascript code.

            <b>Introduction to p5js</b>
            <br>
            P5js was such an amazing new tool that was introduced to us for interactive digital media. We looked at various websites that have implemented p5js in order to see where our designs could go. There are animations, 3D, motion and audio detection, webcam and all sorts of potential when it comes to p5js that I found really intriguing

            <b>Processing</b>
            <br>
            This new software is the tool that will be used to generate p5js code. Interestingly, as we looked into class I found that the language is similar to javascript, therefore I was thrilled at the possibility of me learning this new language and adapting it to my own skills.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b><em>Generating Samples↓↓↓</em></b>

            <br>
            <br>
            The functions of setup and draw were fairly simple to understand, therefore I was able to create new things with it. We tried basic coding samples that played onto the ideas of creating shapes accordingly, as well as generating various colors, shapes and positions. Also, another fun effect was changing the alpha in the draw function as it created a fading animation that gave more life onto the sketch.

            <br>
            <br>
            The randomized code was something that intrigued the class, and we tried to implement that in both our geometries as well as the colors that were generated. We can see from the snippet code here, it is fairly simple and uses the variation of shapes and color as the main aspects. This was adapted from Ashlea’s code in class, but I coordinated it simpler with for loops. I also played around with texts as well.
            <br>
            <br>
            There were other functions such as <em>mousePressed()</em> that listens to the clicking of the mouse for the code to generate as seen.
            <br>
            <br>
            There were many experiments that we did regarding the use of geometric shapes, lines and color and how the mouse motion and pressing affected the relationship between them. There are many examples of the code below where it made it look like I was painting or creating real time animations with only a very few lines of code which I found very interesting.
            <br>

            <b>Iterations</b>
            <br>
            My variation of this week's p5js class session can be seen and accessed by the app <em>BraqueDigitized</em> provided in the desktop.
            <br>
            <br>
            Also, with this week's learning, I created a Doodle type web that allows you to draw, change color and save your live sketches done onto the canvas of your web. The coding here is fairly simple as well which uses the line preset as a way to indicate the strokes and using the mouse reactions of pressing, releasing as well as keyboard press commands to initiate various functions.

            Probably one of the more exciting class sessions where we looked at pushing the visual aspects of creative coding that goes beyond basic geometries. We looked at using our own images and even our webcams as viable assets for your coding. A lot of the teachings from this week were used to create variations of my own p5 sketches.

            We tried using local files (in this case our own images) and manipulating them in our p5js. We used the <em>preload()</em> function in order to identify the images and where they come from. We revisited some similar concepts from last week and generated the images to follow the mouse and allow us to create trails using <em>mousePressed()</em>.

            Probably my favorite feature of p5js. The <em>createCapture(VIDEO);</em> allows your code to access your webcam, allowing to create new opportunities in the interaction of user and computer. We were also introduced with <em>filter()</em> that allows the video to have various effects such as blur and threshold. We played around with this new feature, allowing us to generate a new set of interactive codes using them.

            I tried to implement last week's teachings as well as today's for <em>THRESHCam</em> by instead of having geometries following the mouse, it is instead the video image generated throughout. I wanted to create an experimental interaction that looks like something by Jackson Pollock. Moreover, I let go of the restraints of the sizings and allowed the fluidity of the video to be determined by the direction of the mouse which I found visually interesting. Additionally, I changed the threshold filter onto a custom generated one that allows me to change the strength of the threshold filter and made it possible for me to play along with the effects. This was particularly hard to code since I needed help from websites and example codes however I feel like the code result was satisfying.
            <br>
            <br>
            I tried to push the boundaries even further than just using filters and looked up some interesting ways to generate new images such as ASCII. With the help of several youtube videos I was able to create this new result that looks like it came right out of an algorithmic computer processing. The digital aspect of it makes it visually very striking and I was very pleased with this sketch. This is seen in the <em>ASCIICam</em>.

            <br>
            We took a look at integrating data into our codes. There were many types that we crossed over such as public data in networks, personal data of ourselves and manipulating them into a visual presentation in both codes and exercises. There was also a revisit of the webcam and trying to use data for detecting sound and motion using our cameras and mics.

            <b>Data</b>
            <br>
            There were many kinds of data that we glossed over. Some that stood out to me were data from sound such as volume, data of size and speed, and also personal data in our gadgets as well as our own belongings. We take a look at how data can be interpreted differently.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b><em>Class Exercise↓↓↓</em></b>
            <br>

            <br>
            <br>
            We did a simple class exercise where we had to rearrange our belongings into a presentable data that is categorized according to a particular theme, which in this case is the resale value of our items here. This was really helpful in engaging with how various data can be exhibited visually.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b><em>Visualizing Data↓↓↓</em></b>
            <br>

            <br>
            <br>
            From the Week 4 class, we were able to use those geometric techniques and apply them for this piece of code. Also I revisited a familiar coding structure of <em>for loops<e/m> which help generate a continuous result from a selection of data arrays. We had to visualize our own phone/laptop’s data into a pie chart. This was particularly challenging to understand at first as it was fairly difficult to generate the pie chart successfully, however it was a very important part in understanding how to translate data onto p5js. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <b><em>Motion Detection↓↓↓</em></b>
            <br>

            <br>
            <br>
            At the end of the class, we looked at various sound and motion detection. I didn’t particularly got the time to look deeper into the sound detection but more towards the motion. I wanted to integrate it into a sketch where it allows the computer to detect motion and translate that data onto the web by turning red. This was really fun to play and challenging. The result can be seen in <em>MotionDetector</em> app provided.
