            <b><em>Overview:<br></em></b>
            <br>
            Interestingly, I was enrolled in a different class in the first week. Due to a friend, I was interested in this subject and decided to switch and partake in this since I have always taken a liking in web design. Furthermore, I took a media computation class several semesters ago where I can use the knowledge there and further improve my skills. Since I needed to catch up, I decided to look at some of unique websites with <em>interactivity</em> with very different identities to each of them as a starting point of where I want my own website to look feel. Also, it will help me give an idea how <em>Interactive Media</em> is able to push digital design as well!

            These websites that I've gathered were more focused on the human and website interactions rather than the design aspect of them. I wanted to understand how interactive media has been used even in the most simplistic forms. It was interesting to see the countless possibilities you could do with web design and coding.

            <br>
            I began to visualize and brainstorm how my workbook website will look visually. Throughout this week I looked at several web designs that I found were coherent in their presentation and innovative in terms of its concept and arrangements. I did several sketching workshops as well as it helped me freely create my web front end design without already thinking too much of the technical aspects. At the end of the day, the website should be uniquely yourself and shouldn’t be limited to certain ideas. Starting the coding part was important and I did only html and few css since I wanted to focus more on the layout whereas the functionality will follow along later on.

            Shared several hand picked web designs that I got around to look for in my spare time. These websites to me hold an array of amazing design considerations where they implement their own visual style and language in a unique manner. I love how different they all are and inspiring to me as someone who is trying to create my own site from scratch. There were several characteristics that I took from each of them from the use of color palettes, considering the appropriate typeface to compliment the designs as well as using any other external elements such as images, logos and videos.

            <br>
            The prototyping exercise made me realize that there are various ways I can present my weekly workbook in a creative manner. I realized a lot of these would need repeating elements in order to present the weekly progress in a sufficient way. I loved the results of the left hand side sketches, especially the two middle ones. Initially I wanted to use the octopus wireframe webbings as the design, however I felt that it might not translate too well and the design language is not something I'm particularly a fan of. I loved the overlapping tabs sketch I made, reminding me of virus windows opening up in a computer. That one might be more simple than the previous iteration but I love how I can do a lot visually with it by adding other elements to complement it.

            This week and until the submission date, it’s all about applying the concept of the website into <em>VisualStudioCode</em>. I focused on the html and css aspects first, and then applying the javascript commands onto them. I wanted to focus the visual elements beforehand since I wanted to make sure visually, the design elements all work well alongside one another.

            Handpicked web design inspirations that I want to take the techniques and functionalities of, as their interactive design theme is similar to what I'm trying to replicate in my own design. I really love the abstract and lack of neatness within these websites, which almost bring a raw nature to the design. I want my own website to be eye catching and loud from the moment users open it. In a way, I want the users to slowly explore all the elements within my website instead of the website guiding them along.

            The base skeleton of the process starting with creating the separate divs and titles. As the weeks progress, the div windows will also increase accordingly. I wanted the concept for each window to be its own separate week

            These selected JS codes were the most important ones in helping the user experience of the website. I made sure to have a draggable function for all the separate div windows. Also the implementation of a minimize and expand button to create a flexible impression to the user, allowing them to choose how they want to interact with the respective divs windows. Also since I added the file icons which are clickable, I wanted them to be coded so that it will open up the div windows accordingly. Finally I added a unique detail of code by adding a custom clock that is appropriate to your current location. I feel like these JS commands and the other codes that were not mentioned played an integral part in creating character and depth to the website. It was my goal early on to not only make a website that is visually pleasing, but functional as well.
